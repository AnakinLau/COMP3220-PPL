### Assignment 1
#### Lexical Analyser with Ruby for the language "TINY"
Identify the tokens in this language and build a lexical analyser (lexer) for recognizing and outputting TINY tokens.
###### To Run: Pass the test file name (input.txt ) as 1st Command Line argument and an optional file output name for the 2nd argument

### Assignment 3
#### Top-down Parser in Scheme for the language "TINY"
Read in the tokens generated from a lexer and stored in a file, then create a list of token/lexeme pairs. Write procedures that can correctly interpret all of the rules. More details in .doc file in assignment folder.
###### Note: Please use (pgm) to run the program.

### Assignment 4
#### Prolog Ringing Phone Room Problem
Write a program in Prolog that will tell us how to get from one room of a one-story building, to any other room in that building (if itâ€™s possible), by telling us all of the rooms we must go through to get to the destination room. In addition to the previous statement, there will be phones ringing in one or more of the rooms. Our prolog program should only tell us how to get to those rooms. If we attempt to go to a room that does not have a ringing phone, the program should not produce any output. 
###### Note: Please use path(StartingRoom, Destination). There are only 2 parameters.
